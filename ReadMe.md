# ONEX Emotes List

This script serves as an emote provider, allowing you to add any custom animations you own or use available open-source emotes. You can easily add new emotes to the `AnimList.lua` file.

By default, the script includes the **rpemotes** emote list and streams as a example.

The emote streams used in this project are sourced from **rpemotes-reborn**. The original script can be found at the [rpemotes-reborn GitHub repository](https://github.com/alberttheprince/rpemotes-reborn/tree/master).
